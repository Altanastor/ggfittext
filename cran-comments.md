## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Surrounded all software names with 'single quotes'.

* Added an example to the `geom_fit_text` documentation.

# Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.4.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.1
* win-builder (with `devtools::build_win`)

# R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

# Downstream dependencies

There are no downstream dependencies of this package on CRAN.
